This simple repository contains code and data used in Week 10 of 2023's edition of [DS105A](https://lse-dsi.github.io/DS105/). It includes a demo of a data analysis project involving all the good stuff: scraping with Selenium, creating a database, merging, pivoting and some regular expressions.

This is a sneak peek of the [DISCORDIA project](https://jonjoncardoso.github.io/now.html#project-discordia---uncovering-patterns-of-parliamentary-dissent), a research project led by me with the assistance of research assistants who are former DS105 students!


# ðŸ“š Preparation

If you want to replicate the analysis in this notebook, you will need to:

1. Clone this repository to your computer.
2. Add it to your VS Code workspace.
3. Set up your conda environment:

    ```bash
    conda create -n ds105-w10 python=3.11 ipython
    conda activate ds105-w10
    ```
5. Make sure `pip` is installed inside that environment:

    ```bash
    conda install pip
    ```

6. Now use that pip to install the packages:

    ```bash
    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
5. Open the notebook and run the cells!
